## SGDK_priority_tiles_scripts

#### what's this? a non canonical far from good practices tools to generate pngs with priority tiles ready to be used on SGDK - those are a coulpe of my own tools shared under request so dirty scratch stuff that works

I guess all of them are easy to understand but you should know about the topic to understand what is going on. 

Put all of the scripts on a folder with all your desired pngs - if you want to process all of them on the same run, all must share the same 16 color palette. The reason is the way priority color and palettes are managed. Read script description at the beginning of them. 

what you need? those scripts, a bunch of png to process on the same folder and a palette that complies with master pigsy's tutorial at

if you don't take a look you will barely understand anything.
